        <p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has
            mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black
            highlighters.</p>

        <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred
            by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy
            that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

        <p>CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of
            several historic events, such as: </p>
        

        <ul>
            <li>the Cold War</li>
            <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
            <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
        </ul>
